## MSDS400
Students learn how to build and interpret mathematical models of real-world phenomena in many areas. The course covers linear algebra, discrete mathematics, calculus and graph theory, with an emphasis on applications in data science and data engineering. It provides an introduction to these fields of mathematics prior to enrolling in courses that assume understanding of mathematical concepts.Â  

## MSDS420
This course introduces data management and data preparation with a focus on applications in large-scale analytics projects utilizing relational, document, graph, and graph-relational databases. Students learn about the relational model, the normalization process, and structured query language. They learn about data cleaning and integration, and database programming for extract, transform, and load operations. Students work with unstructured data, indexing and scoring documents for effective and relevant responses to user queries. They learn about graph data models and query processing. Students write programs for data preparation and extraction using various data sources and file formats.
