## Course Description

The course introduces machine learning with business applications. It provides a survey of statistical and machine learning algorithms and techniques including the machine learning framework, regression, classification, regularization and reduction, tree-based methods, unsupervised learning, and fully connected, convolutional, and recurrent neural networks. Students implement machine learning models with open-source software for data science. They explore data and learn from data, finding underlying patterns useful for data reduction, feature analysis, prediction, and classification. 

## Course Objectives
Practical Machine Learning covers the subsequent, numbered learning outcomes.   Each course objective is assessed, and those assessments are annotated in parentheses with A=Assignment, D=Discussion, and E=Examination).  

Apply an ML framework for model building (A1 through A9, D1, E)  
Build and interpret regression models (A2 and A5, D2 and D5, E)  
Build and interpret classification models (A3 and A4, D3 and D4, E)  
Apply and interpret regularization and data reduction methods (A5, D5)  
Build and interpret tree-based models for regression and classification (A6, D6, E)  
Build and interpret unsupervised / semi-supervised learning models (A7, D7, E)  
Build and interpret different types of neural network models (A8 and A9, D8 through D10, E)
