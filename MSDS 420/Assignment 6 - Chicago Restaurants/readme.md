I used the YelpAPI to collect Yelp review data for businesses in the Chicago downtown area and created an EdgeDB Graph-Relational Data Model. 

1. Create the EdgeDB model
2. Retrieve all businesses with 5-star ratings 
3. Retrieve all businesses that offer **Chicago Pizza Style** in Zip-Code 60601  
4. Retrieve top 5 businesses (highest count of reviews) that offer **Chicago Hot Dogs** in Zip-Code 60605 
5. Retrieve 3 reviews of the top 3 businesses (highest count of reviews) that offer Steak in Zip-Code 60611 
6. Retrieve top 5 businesses (highest count of reviews) that offer Hot Dogs in Community Area **Lincoln Park**
7. Retrieve 3 reviews of the top 3 businesses (highest count of reviews) Steak in Community Area **The Loop**
