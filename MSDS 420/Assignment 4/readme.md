This project uses SQL to execute different queries to retrieve data from a massive Chicago Crime dataset. Mostly, we used Geospatial queries to:
- Locate police stations, crimes in every district on a Choropleth map
- Provide descriptive statistics for various incidents
- Provide visualizations for every crime type to make more informed decisions
